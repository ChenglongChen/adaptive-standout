Replication of the paper ["Adaptive dropout for training deep neural
networks"][paper] (with reference to the [related thesis][thesis]). I
apologise to the authors for the name "adaptive-standout", but I didn't
want to call it "adaptive-dropout" as that would imply it was the only
adaptive dropout algorithm; and I couldn't just call it "standout" as that
seemed too general (makes it sound like a social networking product). So
this name incorporates bits of both and makes less coherent sense than
either. Should be OK for a name though.
